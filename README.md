## Roadmap 
If we want to implement multi-player, multi-machine game, we need network programming. [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) is a great choice.  
On the other hand, if we only want to train a RL model, then we should follow the holy rules in this field, which is OpenAI [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)  
A more ambitious goal would be to setup a network game using Twisted and in the meanwhile, with one player the RL model trained by OpenAI gym, LOL. The most ambitious project in human history :D
